## Performance Benchmarking for High Availability Web Applications on AWS

### Abstract
  After the outbreak of coronavirus disease in 2019, there were numerous online shopping websites and online ticketing websites launched by different business companies for selling surgical masks and registration for face masks pre-orders. Since the demand on surgical masks was so tremendous, the websites always received exceptionally high volume of web traffic over a short period of time. The system resources such as CPU and Memory might not be enough to handle the burst traffic. Customers experienced very long loading times or error messages when trying to connect to the websites. Cloud hosting allows customers to run their websites with the flexibility of rapid scale up of system resources when there is a sudden burst of web traffic.
This report presents the findings of system performance for an online shopping website hosting on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with different system setup. Database performance were measured under different database models with customized configurations running on AWS. In this report, we compare the performance difference and evaluate the effectiveness different setup that allow the systems to handle system traffic surge.
